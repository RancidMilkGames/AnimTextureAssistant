# AnimTextureAssistant
A Godot 4 plugin to make creating AnimatedTextures easier

Included is a sample project with the plugin and some images to test with.
To use the plugin in your own project, just copy the files from the addons folder into the addons folder of your project.

Intentions are to make this CC0 in the future. Last tested in Godot 4 beta 3. Future versions of Godot may or may not work with it.
