I plan on making this CC0 once I'm sure I can

Notes:

Speed is the speed scale of playback
Delay is the duration of each frame

If destination is left blank, Animated textures will output to root directory
File name can be left blank. 
Filename will not override files, 
but will instead increment if trying to use the name of a pre-existing file
